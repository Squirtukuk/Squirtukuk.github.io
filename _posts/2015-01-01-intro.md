# Simon Hallam
I am a reliable, enthusiastic person with the ability to work as a valid member of a hard working team or on my
own. I have excellent communication and customer service skills and I’m trustworthy and loyal. With a great sense
of humour and a can do attitude, I have the determination to make things happen. I’m conscientious and carry out
all tasks required and will always go the extra mile to achieve results. I would be keen to undertake any training
required to perform a new role to the best of my ability.
